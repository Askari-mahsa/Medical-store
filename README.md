##Medical-Project-With-ReactJs-Laravel
This project is being developed with Iranian Programmers community. Our effort is to design a web application project based on ReactJs and Laravel that includes all the features of online stores and content-oriented websites.

Our goal is for the community of Laravel and ReactJs programmers to have a source for understanding the structure of projects (in terms of structure and volume of codes) and this source code can become a great resource for learning Laravel and ReactJs.
